# 🎓 Prediction of Engineering Branch Selection for Inter Students

This project is designed to assist Intermediate (10+2) students in selecting the most suitable **engineering branch** based on their academic records using **Machine Learning**. It considers marks, interest areas, and trends to predict and recommend the best-fit B.Tech specialization.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Engineering remains one of the most popular career choices in India. However, students often struggle to choose the **right B.Tech specialization** after Class 12 (MPC stream). This system aims to solve that problem using data-driven insights and recommendation logic.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Help students choose the right engineering branch based on their academic profile.
- Improve student satisfaction and academic performance by matching them with suitable domains.
- Automate the recommendation process using machine learning.

---

## ⚙️ System Features

- Add subject-wise marks for multiple engineering disciplines.
- Calculate average performance across subjects and compare.
- Recommend the most suitable engineering branch (e.g., CSE, ECE, Civil, Mechanical).
- Guide students with career information related to each branch.
- Simple GUI-based standalone application.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Machine Learning** (Classification & Recommendation)
- **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Scikit-learn**
- **Tkinter** (for GUI)
- UML Tools (StarUML/Visual Paradigm) for software modeling

---

## 📐 UML Design

The system is designed using multiple UML diagrams:

- ✅ **Use Case Diagram** – Describes user interactions like Login, Add Marks, View Recommendations.
- ✅ **Class Diagram** – Shows the structure of entities like `Student`, `BranchRecommender`, `MarksRecord`.
- ✅ **Sequence Diagram** – Illustrates step-by-step interaction from data input to prediction output.
- ✅ **Collaboration Diagram** – Highlights component communication.
- ✅ **Activity Diagram** – Represents the flow of recommendation logic.

> All UML diagrams are included in the project files (`Umls.pptx`).

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Logic

- Takes input marks across various subjects and streams.
- Computes per-subject and per-stream averages.
- Based on computed scores, recommends a branch.
- Simple rule-based classification logic with potential for enhancement using ML algorithms like Decision Trees or KNN.
